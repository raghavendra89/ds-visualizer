# Data Structures - Learn by visualizing

[https://dsvisualizer.net](https://dsvisualizer.net)

**How about learning some of the data structures algorithms by visually seeing how they work? I've made a small effort in this site to show you how some algorithms work through the animations.**

Data structures are ways of storing, managing, and organizing data in a computer so that it can be efficiently accessed, modified, and processed. Key algorithms and technologies, such as databases, web indexing, searching, and social networking, rely on data structures to manage underlying data effectively.

The purpose of this site is to teach you some of the most common data structure algorithms through simple animations. Here, you will visually see and understand techniques such as traversing a binary tree and how basic stack operations, like push and pop, are used to implement different algorithms.

For example in this simple animation you will see how a stack is used to reverse a string "Hello". You will also observe how basic `push` and `pop` operations are performed on the stack to implement this algorithm.

Another example shows a technique for traversing binary trees. The animation clearly illustrates how nodes are visited and read in sequence.

As you can see, visualizing how an algorithm works makes it much easier to understand. Iâ€™ve created visualizations for several stack and binary tree algorithms to help clarify their concepts and processes. I hope you find this site both informative and engaging!
