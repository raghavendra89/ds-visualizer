    <p>
        A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, while the bottom-most nodes, which have no child nodes, are known as leaf nodes (or simply leaves).

    <h4>Key Features of a Binary Tree:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Nodes:</strong> Each node in a Binary Tree has three parts: Data and references (or pointers) to its left and right children.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Root:</strong> The top node in the tree. It is the starting point of the tree structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Leaf Nodes:</strong> Nodes that do not have any children (i.e., both their left and right pointers are null).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Internal Nodes:</strong> Nodes that have at least one child (left or right).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Height:</strong> The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Binary Tree Traversal:</h4>
    <p>
        Binary Tree Traversal involves visiting all the nodes of the binary tree in a specific order. Tree traversal algorithms are generally classified into two main categories: <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong> and <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                In <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong>, we aim to visit the nodes as deep as possible, starting from the root. DFS has three main traversal techniques:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Inorder:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then the current node, and then the right subtree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preorder:</strong> Visit the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Postorder:</strong> Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                In <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong>, we prioritize visiting the node closest to the root before moving on to nodes further away. This approach typically uses a queue to explore each level of the tree from top to bottom.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following problems, you will see visualizations demonstrating how these traversal algorithms work in practice.

    <h4>Applications of Binary Trees:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Searching:</strong> Efficient searching (in structures like Binary Search Trees).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sorting:</strong> Binary trees are used in some sorting algorithms (like heaps).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Expression Parsing:</strong> Expression trees (used in compilers) represent mathematical expressions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hierarchical Data Representation:</strong> File systems or organization charts can be represented using binary trees.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Binary trees are fundamental in computer science because of their versatility in various applications like searching, balancing, and tree traversal.
